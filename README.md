object_track.py contains the algorithm for the Eucliden distance tracker. 
Running object_track.py will prompt the user for the tsv file (inference data), 
It will also prompt the user for the directory of the inference images (original images) with or without the tsv file inside. 
The code will run and display output images with the positions of the pollen grains and tube tips tracked. 
TODO: Verify the distances between the tube tips and pollen grain objects.
